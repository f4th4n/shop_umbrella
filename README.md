# Shop.Umbrella

# Why

I want to implement a few ecommerce features in Elixir lang. I'm curious with how elixir manage the flow of ecommerce data.
Features that to be implemented are including cart, checkout, analytic, archives. All of those will be exposed via CLI or iEx only since I'm no good with frontend stuff.

# Installation

## Development Mode

1. Create postgres db
	 `$ mix ecto.create`

2. Start server
	 `$ iex -S mix phx.server`
